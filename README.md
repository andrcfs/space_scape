# SpaceScape

StarScape is a fast-paced, time survival game set in the vast, dangerous expanse of
space being developted with Flutter's Flame Engine. Players control a spaceship and must survive against relentless waves of alien
hordes and asteroids. This game is based on the rogue-lite mechanics of survival
against overwhelming odds. Your goal is simple: survive as long as possible and
gather resources to unlock ships and upgrades for future battles.

The game is heavily inspired by Vampire Survivors, but also StarCraft and StarWars.
